I think I have followed the steps to implement NBC on the slide,
but the accuracy is abnormal. If you have some time, please take a
glance at my nbc function to check if it is possible to get some
points before scoring. Thanks!

By the way, each python file is independent,  you need to execute preprocess-assg3
first then lr_svm then cv. File preprocess2 is from HW2 solution, and I use it to generate
csv which is used in nbc learning. Moreover, I have used prep function to generate
dating-binned.csv in cv.py, so I commented it.
